# The First Website
A replica of info.cern.ch

## General Info
We recreated the first [website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
 with slight stylistic adjustments. However, due to the hundreds of links, this replica
 only descends one level, including pages for the following categories and several others.

- What's out there
- Software
- Technical
- Getting code
- Help
- People
- How you can help
- History
- Bibliography

# Problem and Solution
The goal of the project was to replicate a portion of the first website, info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/

We accomplished this by recreating the index page and all 23 pages linked therefrom. We split the work
by assigning David 14 of these pages as well as the added About Us page, and Casey the remaining 9 pages
and the stylesheet. Git version control was well utilized for merging our work together, updating the peoject,
and pulling/pushing the latest changes.

## Process
We replicated the main page and the 23 linked pages one at a time.  We found there were some
formatting errors, but for the most part kept them in order to stay true to the original.

We also employed some uncommon HTML tags, such as:     
Definition List/Term/Data     (DL) / (DT) / (DD)  
Extensible Metadata Platform  (XMP)  
And we set alternative link colors (green, red, and brown/orange).

## Languages, Tools and Resources
Project was created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* PhpStorm
* GitHub
* Mozilla Developer [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/) as a reference for HTML and CSS

## Sources
This project was inspired by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.  Tim is a computer scientist from England who started the very first 
website while working for CERN, a particle physics lab in Switzerland.  He is a professor at MIT in Cambridge, MA.
